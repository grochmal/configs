README for sensitive directory
------------------------------

This is the location of files containing sensitive data, e.g. the usernames and
passwords for the email authentication.  The actual files are mounted through
an AES loopback with dm-crypt/LUKS.

The directory in the repository contains only examples of how these
configuration files shall be setup.
